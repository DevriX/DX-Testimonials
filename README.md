# DX Testimonials

DX Testimonials is a boilerplate plugin that provides the basic functionality for creating a functionality for adding clients testimonials

We'll add new helper functions and basic functionality, which will be used only for the backend part of the feature.

For any visual and front-end related tasks, you'll have to add a support for the plugin, such as an additional styling, slider option, etc

Suggestions and contributions are welcomed
